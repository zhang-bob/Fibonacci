[Function test]
1. ensure customer can get a fibonacci array if input a common positive number: like http http://127.0.0.1:8000/fibonacci/50
2. ensure customer can get a fibonacci array if he only want to get first 1 and/or 2 number, which is the head of fobinacci array

[boundary test]
1. ensure customer can get a meaningful error message if input a number zero
2. ensure maximum number the program can support, it's 5000 in current code

[Robustness test]
1. negative integer is not allowed, customer can get a meaningful error message
2. float, string or other types are not supported, customer can get a meaningful error message
3. an integer bigger than maximum is not allowed

[performance test]
1. ensure customer can get response in expected range

[concurrent test]
1. ensure the program works if there are hundreds of requests at same time

[security]
1. ensure any input won't affect data structure in server side. for this case it's safe because we don't use database
2. ensure any request never affect each other, it's thread safe
